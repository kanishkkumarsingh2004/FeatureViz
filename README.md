# FeatureViz: Visualizing CNN Features for Cats vs. Dogs Classification

## Overview
**FeatureViz** is a visualization tool designed to display the feature maps extracted by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) during the Cats vs. Dogs image classification task. The tool helps users understand how the CNN processes input images by displaying intermediate feature maps from various layers of the model. This understanding can aid in model interpretation, performance improvement, and debugging.

Feature extraction in CNNs helps the model capture low-level features (such as edges and textures) in earlier layers and higher-level features (such as object parts) in deeper layers. Visualizing these extracted features allows us to understand what the model "sees" at each stage of the processing.

## Key Features
- **Feature Map Visualization**: The tool visualizes the feature maps at different layers of the CNN, showing how the network detects various patterns and structures in the image.
- **Easy Integration**: You can integrate the feature extraction process into your existing CNN-based Cats vs. Dogs classification pipeline.
- **Model Interpretability**: By examining the feature maps, you can gain insights into what the model focuses on when making predictions, which is critical for debugging and improving model performance.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple and intuitive visualizations that help users, even those with limited deep learning experience, understand how CNNs process images.

## Prerequisites
Before running the tool, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- **torch**: For building and training CNN models.
- **torchvision**: Contains pre-trained models and image transformation utilities.
- **opencv-python**: For image processing (loading, resizing, etc.).
- **matplotlib**: For displaying the feature maps visually.
- **numpy**: For handling image arrays and numerical operations.

To install these dependencies, use the following command:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision opencv-python matplotlib numpy
```

## Code Overview

### Step 1: Load and Preprocess the Image
The first step is to load an image, resize it to the appropriate input size (224x224 pixels in this case), and convert it to the correct color format (RGB). This preprocessing step ensures that the image is ready to be passed into the CNN model.


- **Functionality**: Loads an image from a specified path, resizes it to a square (224x224), and converts it to RGB.
- **Purpose**: Prepares the image for input into the CNN.

### Step 2: Define the CNN Model
In this step, a CNN model is defined. This model consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers. The convolutional layers extract features at different levels of abstraction, and the fully connected layers perform the final classification.

You can use a custom CNN architecture or integrate a pre-trained model such as VGG16, ResNet, etc., for feature extraction. The model definition includes layers for convolution, pooling, and fully connected components, with activation functions like ReLU for non-linearity.

- **Functionality**: Defines a basic CNN architecture with convolutional layers and fully connected layers.
- **Purpose**: Extracts features from the image using convolutional layers and then classifies the features with fully connected layers.

### Step 3: Feature Extraction and Visualization
Once the image is processed and passed through the model, feature maps are extracted from the convolutional layers. These feature maps represent the patterns the model has detected at each layer of the network. These maps are visualized using matplotlib for easy analysis.

The visualized feature maps provide insight into how the model detects edges, textures, and object parts at different layers. You can observe which areas of the image are being highlighted by the model at each layer, helping you understand how the network works internally.

- **Functionality**: Extracts and visualizes feature maps from the convolutional layers of the model.
- **Purpose**: Provides insights into the modelâ€™s feature extraction process, aiding in interpretability.

### Step 4: Model Training Integration (Optional)
This code is designed primarily for feature extraction visualization. If you wish to train the model with the Cats vs. Dogs dataset, you can integrate the feature extraction code into your existing training pipeline.

The model can be trained using the following steps:

Prepare the dataset [(Cats vs. Dogs).
Pass the images through the CNN model.
Extract the features using the feature extraction code.
Use the extracted features for classification and backpropagation.
For a complete training pipeline, refer to the [Cats vs. Dogs classification model notebook](https://github.com/kanishkkumarsingh2004/Cats_and_Dogs_classification/blob/main/cats_and_dog_classification.ipynb), which includes code for training the model.

- **Functionality**: Combines feature extraction with the training pipeline to create a complete model.
- **Purpose**: Allows for model training using the Cats vs. Dogs dataset and feature extraction.
